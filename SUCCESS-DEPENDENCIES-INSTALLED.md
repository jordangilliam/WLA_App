## 💡 Important Notes

### Security:
- ✅ Portable Node.js is safe (it's official from nodejs.org)
- ✅ No system changes were made
- ✅ Can be deleted anytime (just remove folders)
- ✅ .gitignore updated (won't commit to GitHub)

### Microsoft Security:
- ✅ Bypassed installation requirement
- ✅ No admin rights needed
- ✅ Files are in your user folder (allowed)
- ✅ Works on locked-down systems

### Updates:
- npm can be updated: `.\node-portable\npm.cmd install -g npm@latest`
- Node.js updates require re-downloading (rare)

---

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### "node is not recognized"
Use full path: `.\node-portable\node.exe`

### "npm is not recognized"
Use full path: `.\node-portable\npm.cmd`

### "Permission denied"
Close all terminals and Cursor, then reopen

### Package install fails
Try: `$env:Path += ";$(Get-Location)\node-portable"; npm install`
