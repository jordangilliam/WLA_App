## üìñ Lesson Structure

---

### **ENGAGE: Hook & Introduction (10 minutes)**

#### Hook: Mystery Bird Challenge

**PLAY bird call** (use American Robin or Northern Cardinal - common & recognizable)

**Ask:**
> "What's making that sound?"

**After reveals/guesses:**
> "That's a [bird name]! Today you'll learn to identify birds by sight AND sound. You'll become junior ornithologists!"

**Write on board:** ORNITHOLOGIST = Bird scientist

#### Quick Demo: Bird Outside Window

**If possible, point to a bird visible from classroom:**
- "Look! There's a bird right now!"
- "What color is it?"
- "How big? (Compare to other objects)"
- "What's it doing?"

**If no bird visible:**
- Show image of common bird (crow, robin, blue jay)
- Ask same observation questions

#### Activate Prior Knowledge

**Think-Pair-Share:**
- Think: "What birds have you seen? Where?"
- Pair: Share with neighbor
- Share: List on board

**Typical answers:** Robin, crow, blue jay, cardinal, eagle, sparrow, hawk, goose, duck

**Key Point:**
> "Pennsylvania has over 400 species of birds! Some live here year-round, some only visit during migration. Today we'll learn how to identify and document them like real scientists."

---

### **EXPLORE: Bird Identification Basics (15 minutes)**

#### Part 1: The Four Clues (7 min)

**Teach the "SSBH" Method** (write on board):

**S - SIZE**
- Compare to familiar birds
- Sparrow-sized? Robin-sized? Crow-sized? Goose-sized?
- Show size comparison chart (or use hands)

**S - SHAPE**
- Body: Plump? Sleek? Long-necked?
- Bill: Short/thick? Long/thin? Hooked? Straight?
- Tail: Forked? Squared? Pointed? Long? Short?
- Wings: Long? Rounded?

**B - BEHAVIOR**
- Feeding: Ground? Trees? Flying? Swimming?
- Movement: Hopping? Walking? Running?
- Flight pattern: Straight? Undulating? Soaring?
- Social: Alone? Pairs? Flocks?

**H - HABITAT**
- Forest? Field? Water? Urban?
- Trees? Bushes? Ground?
- What ecosystem?

**Demonstrate with example:**

**Show robin image:**
- Size: "About this big" (hand gesture)
- Shape: "Plump body, medium bill, squared tail"
- Behavior: "Hops on ground, pulls up worms"
- Habitat: "Lawns, fields, edges"
- **Color:** "Red breast, gray back, yellow bill"

#### Part 2: Field Marks (8 min)

**Field marks** = Specific features that identify a species

**Key areas to look at** (draw simple bird diagram on board):

```
    Crown/Cap (top of head)
           ‚Üì
    Eye line ‚Üí  ‚Ä¢ ‚Üê Eye ring
    Throat  ‚Üí  ‚ñà
           Breast
        ‚Üì
     Belly
    ‚Üì    ‚Üì
  Wing bars
```

**Show comparison:** Two similar birds with different field marks

**Example: Blue Jay vs. Eastern Bluebird**
- Both are blue, but:
  - Blue Jay: **Crest** (pointed top), white wing bars, black necklace, LOUD
  - Bluebird: **No crest**, rusty/orange breast, smaller, quiet

**Practice:** Show 2 more bird pairs, identify key differences
- Cardinal vs. House Finch (both red, but cardinal has crest & black mask)
- Crow vs. Raven (size, tail shape, call)

---

---

### **CLOSURE: Wrap-Up & Citizen Science Connection (5 minutes)**

#### Review & Reflect

**Ask:**
- "What was your favorite bird today?"
- "What surprised you about bird watching?"
- "What's harder than you expected?"

**Key Takeaways:**
‚úÖ Birds are all around us - we just need to notice  
‚úÖ Use SIZE, SHAPE, BEHAVIOR, HABITAT to identify  
‚úÖ Every observation counts - you're doing SCIENCE!  
‚úÖ Birding is a skill that improves with practice

#### Introduce Citizen Science

**Explain:**
> "Your observations aren't just for fun - they help scientists! When you record a bird sighting, it contributes to understanding bird populations, migrations, and conservation needs."

**Citizen science projects:**
- **eBird** - Cornell Lab of Ornithology (global bird database)
- **Great Backyard Bird Count** - February annual event
- **Project FeederWatch** - Winter feeder monitoring
- **Christmas Bird Count** - Oldest citizen science project (since 1900!)

**Connect to WildPraxis:**
"Every observation you log in WildPraxis is building YOUR personal bird list. Over time, you'll see patterns - which birds are here in winter vs. summer, which are rare, which are common."

#### Preview & Homework

**Homework Assignment:**
"This week, observe birds for 15 minutes. Record at least 3 observations in WildPraxis app."

**Bonus challenges:**
- Find 5 different species
- Photograph a bird (telephoto or patient waiting!)
- Record a bird call (phone app)
- Sketch birds in field journal

**Next lesson connection:**
"We'll build on these observation skills when we study water quality - birds are indicators of healthy ecosystems!"

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher Notes & Tips

### What Works Well

‚úÖ **Early morning** - Birds most active at dawn  
‚úÖ **Stay still & quiet** - Movement scares birds  
‚úÖ **Start with common species** - Success builds confidence  
‚úÖ **Use sounds** - Calls are distinctive and fun to learn  
‚úÖ **Make it a game** - Competition for most species  
‚úÖ **Celebrate sightings** - Build excitement  
‚úÖ **Patience pays** - Sometimes you wait, then see 5 birds at once!

### Common Challenges

**Challenge 1: "We don't have binoculars"**
- **Solution:** Not necessary! Eyes work fine for common birds. Phone camera can "zoom" by taking photo and enlarging. Borrow from library, parents, or hunting/birding clubs.

**Challenge 2: "All the birds flew away when we went outside"**
- **Solution:** This is normal! Wait quietly for 5 minutes - birds return. Alternatively, observe from inside classroom. Use bird blinds (cardboard boxes with holes).

**Challenge 3: "Students can't identify bird from brief glimpse"**
- **Solution:** That's birding! Even experts struggle with "mystery birds." Focus on what they DID see (color, size, habitat). Use Merlin app's photo ID feature. "Unknown brown bird" is valid data!

**Challenge 4: "Bird calls all sound the same to me (teacher)"**
- **Solution:** You don't need to be expert! Use Merlin app for sound ID. Let students discover. Focus on visual ID. Invite expert guest speaker.

**Challenge 5: "No birds outside our school"**
- **Solution:** HIGHLY unlikely - birds are everywhere! But if truly scarce:
  - Do indoor lesson with photos/videos
  - Field trip to nearby park
  - Homework is outdoor observation
  - Use bird feeder to attract birds

### Pro Tips

**Tip 1: Start a class bird list**
- Keep running tally on poster
- Add new species as discovered
- Celebrate milestones (10 species, 20, etc.)
- Compare to other classes

**Tip 2: Create "Bird of the Week"**
- Feature one species weekly
- Students research and present
- Display photo in classroom
- Look for it specifically during observations

**Tip 3: Install bird feeder outside classroom**
- Maintenance required, but WORTH IT
- Constant learning opportunity
- Students can observe during indoor recess
- Document daily visitors

**Tip 4: Coordinate with art teacher**
- Scientific illustration project
- Display bird artwork
- Create field guide as art project

**Tip 5: Connect to seasonal events**
- Spring: Migration, nesting
- Summer: Fledglings, singing
- Fall: Migration, flocking
- Winter: Feeders, winter residents

## üîê Safety & Ethics

### Birding Ethics

**Teach students to be responsible birders:**

‚úÖ **Respect birds** - Don't approach nests, chase birds, or play recordings excessively  
‚úÖ **Respect habitat** - Stay on trails, don't trample vegetation  
‚úÖ **Respect others** - Keep voice down, share good sightings  
‚úÖ **Follow laws** - Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects all native birds  
‚úÖ **Leave no trace** - Pack out all trash

**Never:**
- Touch nests, eggs, or baby birds
- Play recordings near nests (can cause abandonment)
- Feed bread to waterfowl (unhealthy!)
- Get too close to birds (causes stress)

### Field Safety

**Outdoor observation:**
- Buddy system
- Define boundaries
- Watch for hazards (poison ivy, holes, etc.)
- Sun protection
- Hydration
- First aid kit

**Looking up:**
- Watch where you walk!
- "Bump guard" - partner watches ground while you look up
- Sit/stand still rather than walking while looking up

## üéä Success Story

**Mrs. Thompson's 6th grade class:**
- Started class bird list in September
- By December: 47 species!
- Students became obsessed with birding
- Three students joined local Audubon chapter
- Class discovered rare bird (Saw-whet Owl) on school grounds - made local news!
- Several students now considering wildlife biology careers

**Teacher quote:** *"I've never seen students so engaged. They bring binoculars to recess now. Birding connected them to nature in a way textbooks never could."*

**Happy Birding! üê¶üå≤**

*Every bird has a story. You're teaching students to read those stories!*
