## 📖 Lesson Structure

---

### **PART 1: CLASSROOM INTRODUCTION (30 minutes)**

#### **ENGAGE: Hook (5 minutes)**

**Show two photos side-by-side:**
- Crystal clear stream
- Polluted, murky stream

**Ask:**
> "Which stream would you want to fish in? Swim in? Drink from? Why?"

**Reveal:**
> "Sometimes you can't tell water quality just by looking! Today you'll become water quality scientists - testing water using chemistry AND biology."

**Real-world connection:**
"Every stream, river, and lake in PA has a health report card - just like you get in school! Scientists test water to see if it's healthy enough for fish, wildlife, and people."

---

#### **EXPLORE: Two Ways to Test Water Quality (10 minutes)**

**Method 1: Chemical Testing**

**Explain:**
"We test for specific chemicals that affect water health."

**Key parameters** (write on board):

| Parameter | What it is | Why it matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Temperature** | How hot/cold | Affects oxygen, fish species |
| **pH** | Acidity/alkalinity | Fish need 6.5-8.5; outside this = stress |
| **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** | Oxygen in water | Fish need 5+ mg/L to survive |
| **Nitrates** | Nitrogen compounds | High levels = fertilizer runoff, algae blooms |
| **Phosphates** | Phosphorus compounds | High levels = pollution, algae |

**Demonstrate one test** (if time):
- Test tap water for pH using test kit
- Show color change
- Compare to chart
- Record result

**Method 2: Biological Testing (Biotic Index)**

**Explain:**
"Some insects can live in polluted water, but others can't. By counting which insects are present, we can determine water quality!"

**The Three Categories:**
1. **Pollution-Sensitive** (Score: 3 points each)
   - Stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies
   - Need CLEAN, oxygen-rich water
   - If you find these = GOOD water!

2. **Somewhat Sensitive** (Score: 2 points each)
   - Dragonflies, damselflies, beetles
   - Tolerant of some pollution
   - Middle-level indicators

3. **Pollution-Tolerant** (Score: 1 point each)
   - Aquatic worms, leeches, midges, snails
   - Can live in dirty water
   - If you ONLY find these = POOR water

**Visual:**
```
CLEAN WATER              MEDIUM                 POLLUTED WATER
Stoneflies (3)           Dragonflies (2)        Leeches (1)
Mayflies (3)             Beetles (2)            Worms (1)
Caddisflies (3)          Damselflies (2)        Snails (1)
```

**Key Point:**
> "Biology is a long-term indicator. Chemicals show what's happening RIGHT NOW. Biology shows what's been happening over weeks/months. We'll use BOTH methods!"

---

#### **EXPLAIN: Field Procedures (15 minutes)**

**Safety First! (5 min)**

**Rules for stream work:**
1. **Buddy system** - Always!
2. **Wade carefully** - Test each step, slippery rocks
3. **Water depth** - No deeper than mid-calf without teacher permission
4. **Stay in boundaries** - Between marked areas only
5. **Respect wildlife** - Gentle hands, return organisms
6. **Listen for whistle** - 1 blast = freeze, 2 blasts = return to shore

**Demo safe wading:**
- Sideways shuffle (don't cross feet)
- Test footing before weight
- Face upstream (stronger stance)
- Use net for balance

**Chemical Testing Procedure (5 min)**

**Teacher demonstrates:**

1. **Collect water sample**
   - Mid-stream (not shore)
   - Below surface (not top)
   - Fill bottle halfway

2. **Run tests in order** (follow kit instructions)
   - Temperature first (affects other tests)
   - pH
   - Dissolved oxygen
   - Nitrates
   - Phosphates

3. **Record results** on data sheet

**Biological Sampling Procedure (5 min)**

**Teacher demonstrates:**

1. **Place net downstream of feet**
2. **Kick/disturb rocks and gravel for 30 seconds**
3. **Lift net carefully**
4. **Transfer contents to white tray with water**
5. **Sort through debris**
6. **Identify organisms** (use ID cards, WildPraxis app)
7. **Count by category** (sensitive, somewhat, tolerant)
8. **Calculate biotic index score**
9. **Return organisms gently to stream**

**Calculation:** (Total points ÷ Total organisms) × 10 = Biotic Index

**Interpretation:**
- Score 23-30 = Excellent
- Score 17-22 = Good
- Score 11-16 = Fair
- Score 0-10 = Poor

  - Substrate (mud, gravel, rocks, bedrock)
  - Cover (overhanging vegetation, logs, undercut banks)
  - Human impacts (trash, pipes, development)
- Photograph habitat
- Note fish observed (if any)

**Teacher Role:**
- Circulate among stations

### **PART 3: DATA ANALYSIS & CONCLUSIONS (30 minutes)**

#### **Compile Class Data (10 minutes)**

**Create data table on board:**

| Team | Temp | pH | DO | Nitrates | Phosphates | Biotic Index | Water Quality |
|------|------|----|----|----------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | | |

**Calculate class averages**

**Discuss discrepancies:**
- "Why did Team 2 get different result?"
- "Which tests were hardest? Why?"
- "Did biology and chemistry agree?"

#### **Analyze Results (10 minutes)**

**Guided questions:**

✅ Parent volunteers - essential for safety

### Common Challenges

**Challenge: "We can't find any organisms"**
- Sample riffles (fast, rocky areas) not pools
- Check under rocks
- Sample aquatic vegetation
- Try different habitat types

**Challenge: "Test kit results don't make sense"**
- Follow instructions exactly
- Check expiration dates
- Time tests precisely
- Use fresh reagents

**Challenge: "Water is too deep/fast/cold"**
- Choose site carefully in advance
- Adjust season (late summer = lower water)
- Wade from shore, don't go in center
- Teacher collects samples if needed
