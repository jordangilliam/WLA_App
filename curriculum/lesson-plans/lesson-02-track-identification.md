## üìñ Lesson Structure

---

### **ENGAGE: Hook & Activate Prior Knowledge (10 minutes)**

#### Hook Activity: "Mystery Track"

**Display large track image on screen** (deer, dog, or raccoon)

**Ask:**
> "What animal made this track? How do you know?"

**Students guess:** Dog? Cat? Bear? 

**Reveal answer** and discuss clues

#### Think-Pair-Share (5 min)
1. **Think:** "Have you ever seen animal tracks? Where?"
2. **Pair:** Share with a partner
3. **Share:** Volunteers share with class

**List on board:**
- Where they've seen tracks (mud, snow, sand, dirt)
- What animals they think made them
- Questions they have about tracking

#### Introduction to Tracking
> "Today you're going to become wildlife detectives! Trackers are scientists who read stories written in mud, snow, and sand. Every animal leaves clues about where it went, what it was doing, and how it was moving."

**Key Point:**
"Tracking is one of humanity's oldest skills - used by hunters, naturalists, search & rescue teams, and wildlife biologists."

---

### **EXPLORE: Track Basics (15 minutes)**

#### Part 1: Anatomy of a Track (5 min)

**Draw basic track on board with labels:**

```
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îÇ  ‚óè ‚óè    ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Toe pads
    ‚îÇ   ‚óè‚óè    ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ    ‚ñ¨    ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Heel pad
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
       ‚Üë
    Palm/Foot pad
```

**Key Features to Look For:**
1. **Number of toes** - 4? 5? 2? (Cloven hoof)
2. **Claw marks** - Present or absent?
3. **Pad shape** - Round? Triangular? Oval?
4. **Size** - Length and width
5. **Symmetry** - Even or offset?

**Show examples:**
- **Dog/Coyote:** 4 toes, claws show, triangular pad
- **Cat:** 4 toes, NO claws (retractable), round pad
- **Deer:** 2 toes (cloven hoof), dewclaws may show
- **Raccoon:** 5 toes, looks like tiny hands!

#### Part 2: Track Patterns & Gaits (10 min)

**Explain that HOW an animal moves tells us what it is:**

**1. Diagonal Walk (Dogs, Cats, Deer)**
```
LF     RF     LF     RF
   LH     RH     LH     RH

Pattern: Alternating, regular stride
```

**2. Hopper (Rabbits, Squirrels)**
```
    LF RF
  LH     RH

Pattern: Front feet side-by-side, back feet ahead
```

**3. Bounder (Weasels, Otters)**
```
LF RF  [space]  LF RF  [space]
LH RH           LH RH

Pattern: Pairs of tracks, then jump
```

**4. Pacer (Raccoons, Bears)**
```
LF         RF
LH         RH

Pattern: Same-side feet together
```

**Demonstrate with stuffed animals** (if available)
- Move animal across desk/floor
- Show how feet land in different patterns
- Students imitate animal gaits (fun, kinesthetic!)

**Key Teaching Point:**
> "The pattern is often MORE important than a single track. If you see hopping pattern, you know it's a rabbit or squirrel - not a deer!"

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher Notes & Tips

### What Works Well

‚úÖ **Real tracks beat pictures** - If possible, find tracks beforehand and bring photos OR take class outside  
‚úÖ **Snow is magic** - Best tracking medium, if available  
‚úÖ **Movement activities** - Kids love imitating animal gaits  
‚úÖ **Competition element** - Identification challenge keeps engagement high  
‚úÖ **Immediate application** - Homework connects to real world right away

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: "We don't have any tracks to show"**
- **Solution:** Use WildPraxis app images on projector, or find royalty-free images online. Create "track stamps" using craft foam and show prints in sandbox/tray of dirt.

**Challenge 2: "Students confuse dog and coyote tracks"**
- **Solution:** Focus on size and efficiency. Coyote tracks are tighter, more oval, more direct pattern. For beginners, just call them "dog family" - that's good enough!

**Challenge 3: "Students struggle to remember track features"**
- **Solution:** Use mnemonics:
  - "Dogs Direct, Cats Concealed" (claws)
  - "Rabbits' Run Repeats" (hopping pattern)
  - "Deer have Divided toes" (cloven hoof)

**Challenge 4: "No tracks found for homework"**
- **Solution:** Have backup digital activity - identify tracks from photo bank in app. Still valuable learning! Or offer extra credit if they find real tracks.

**Challenge 5: "Indoor class time feels disconnected from real tracking"**
- **Solution:** Bring nature IN:
  - Create track stamps (craft foam on wood blocks)
  - Set up "tracking stations" with prints in sand/mud trays
  - Show videos of animals walking/running
  - Use stuffed animals for gait demonstrations

### Time Management

**If SHORT on time (30 minutes):**
1. Skip detailed gait explanation (3 min intro only)
2. Focus on "Big 3": deer, rabbit, dog (7 min)
3. Quick app exploration (10 min)
4. Brief exit ticket (5 min)

**If EXTRA time (90+ minutes):**
1. Full lesson as written (45 min)
2. ADD:
   - Track casting demonstration (15 min)
   - Outdoor track hunt on school grounds (20 min)
   - More detailed gait practice (10 min)
   - Guest speaker (30 min) - schedule ahead!

**Ideal pacing:**
- Don't rush app exploration - that's where mastery happens
- Identification challenge should be FUN and fast-paced
- Build excitement for homework/field trip

---

## üîê Safety Considerations

### Classroom Safety
- Scissors for cutting cards - standard classroom safety
- If using plaster - avoid inhalation of dry powder, ventilate
- Hand washing after handling materials

### Outdoor Safety (Field Extension)
- Buddy system always
- Define boundaries clearly
- Don't touch scat or remains (observe only)
- Watch for hazards (poison ivy, holes, sharp objects)
- Stay on trails or designated areas
- Weather-appropriate clothing
- First aid kit with group

### Wildlife Encounters
- **If you see the animal making tracks:**
  - Observe from distance
  - Do NOT approach
  - Stay calm and quiet
  - Back away slowly if too close
  - Tell teacher immediately

**Safety rule:** "We track animals, we don't follow them!"
