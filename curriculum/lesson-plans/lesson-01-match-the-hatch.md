## 📖 Lesson Structure

---

### **ENGAGE: Hook & Activate Prior Knowledge (10 minutes)**

#### Hook Question (Write on board)
> **"Why do fish only eat certain things at certain times?"**

#### Opening Activity
1. **Show image** - Display photo of trout feeding on water surface
2. **Think-Pair-Share** (3 min)
   - Think: "What do you think fish eat?"
   - Pair: Discuss with neighbor
   - Share: Collect answers on board

3. **Reveal the Answer**
   - "Fish eat whatever insects are hatching RIGHT NOW!"
   - "This is called 'matching the hatch'"
   - "Today you'll become insect detectives!"

#### Activate Prior Knowledge - KWL Chart
Create on chart paper:
| **K** (Know) | **W** (Want to Know) | **L** (Learned - end of class) |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| (Student responses) | (Student questions) | (Fill in at end) |

**Prompt questions:**
- "What insects have you seen near water?"
- "How do insects grow and change?"
- "Why might insects be important to fish?"

---

### **EXPLORE: Introduction to Aquatic Insects (15 minutes)**

#### Part 1: What Makes an Insect "Aquatic"? (5 min)

**Interactive discussion:**
- "Where do these insects live?" → *In water (larvae) and air (adults)*
- "How do they breathe underwater?" → *Gills, like fish*
- "Why are they important?" → *Food for fish, water quality indicators*

**Key Vocabulary** (write on board):
- **Nymph/Larvae** - Baby insect stage (lives in water)
- **Emergence** - When insect leaves water to become adult
- **Hatch** - Lots of insects emerging at once
- **Metamorphosis** - Transformation from larva to adult

#### Part 2: The Three VIPs (10 min)

**Teach the "Big Three" insect groups:**

1. **Mayflies (Ephemeroptera)** 🪰
   - Delicate, 2-3 tail filaments
   - Live as nymphs for 1 year, adults for 1 day!
   - "Ephemeral" = short-lived
   - **Show:** Image of mayfly nymph and adult

2. **Caddisflies (Trichoptera)** 🐛
   - Build cases from pebbles/sticks (show image!)
   - Moth-like adults, tent-shaped wings
   - Indicator of good water quality
   - **Show:** Image of caddis case and adult

3. **Stoneflies (Plecoptera)** 🪲
   - Two tail filaments, flat body
   - Need cold, clean, oxygen-rich water
   - "Canary in the coal mine" - disappear when water gets polluted
   - **Show:** Image of stonefly nymph and adult

**Teacher Demonstration:**
If you have specimens:
- Pass around preserved insects
- Use hand lenses to observe details
- Point out: "How many legs? (6) How many body segments? (3)"

**If no specimens:**
- Use app images on projector
- Zoom in on details
- Show side-by-side of nymph vs. adult

---

### **EXPLAIN: Life Cycles & Emergence (10 minutes)**

#### Part 1: Metamorphosis Types (5 min)

**Draw on board or use diagram:**

**Incomplete Metamorphosis** (Mayflies, Stoneflies)
```
Egg → Nymph (looks like small adult) → Adult
  ↓
Lives in water → Emerges → Flies away
```

**Complete Metamorphosis** (Caddisflies)
```
Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult
  ↓        ↓      ↓
In water → Case → Emerges
```

**Discussion:**
- "Which transformation is more dramatic?" → *Caddisflies (like caterpillar to butterfly)*
- "How long do nymphs live in the water?" → *Several months to a year*
- "How long do adults live?" → *Hours to a few days*

#### Part 2: Why Timing Matters (5 min)

**The "Hatch" Concept:**
- Insects don't emerge randomly - they respond to:
  - Water temperature (most important!)
  - Day length
  - Season
  - Weather

**Create "Emergence Calendar" on board:**
| Month | Main Hatches |
|-------|--------------|
| March-April | Early stoneflies, midges |
| May-June | Sulphurs, March Browns, caddis |
| June-July | Tricos, terrestrials |
| Sept-Oct | Blue-winged Olives |

**Key Teaching Point:**
> "If you were a fish, and thousands of insects were on the water, you'd eat ONLY that insect. That's why anglers 'match the hatch' - use flies that look like what's hatching!"

---

### **ELABORATE: App-Based Learning Activity (25 minutes)**

#### Part 1: Guided App Tour (5 min)

**Teacher demonstrates on projector:**

1. **Navigate to Match the Hatch**
   - WildPraxis App → Fishing → Match the Hatch tab
   - "This is your field guide to PA aquatic insects!"

2. **Show key features:**
   - **9 insect profiles** - Click on Sulphur Mayfly
   - **Life cycle info** - See nymph and adult stages
   - **Emergence times** - When they hatch
   - **Fly patterns** - What anglers use to imitate them
   - **Interactive quiz** - Test your knowledge

3. **Explain the game:**
   - "You'll see a scenario: water temp, time of year, location"
   - "Your job: identify which insect is hatching"
   - "Match the insect to the right fly pattern"
   - **Points & Badges:** Earn points, build streak, unlock "Aquatic Ecologist" badge

#### Part 2: Independent/Partner Exploration (15 min)

**Instructions for students:**

1. **Explore (5 min)**
   - Open Match the Hatch in your app
   - Explore all 9 insect profiles
   - Read about nymph stage, emergence, patterns
   - **Look for:** Water temp preferences, season, tips

2. **Practice Quiz (10 min)**
   - Start the Match the Hatch challenge
   - Work individually or with a partner
   - Aim for 5/5 correct matches
   - Use hints if needed!
   - Raise hand if stuck

**Teacher Role During Activity:**
- Circulate classroom
- Check progress on devices
- Provide hints: "Look at the water temperature - what insects like cold water?"
- Celebrate successes: "Great job! You're on a 3-match streak!"
- Address technical issues
- Take note of struggling students for future support

**Success Criteria:**
- Student completes at least 5 challenges
- Student explains reasoning for one match
- Student earns points toward badge

#### Part 3: Debrief & Discussion (5 min)

**Gather class attention:**

**Discussion Questions:**
1. "Which insect was hardest to identify? Why?"
2. "What patterns did you notice?" (*Larger insects in colder water, smaller in warmer*)
3. "Why does water temperature matter so much?" (*Insects are cold-blooded*)
4. "How is this similar to real fishing?" (*Observation, pattern recognition*)

**Highlight Learning:**
- "You're now thinking like an angler AND a biologist!"
- "Anglers are citizen scientists - they notice patterns"

---

### **EVALUATE: Assessment & Closure (10 minutes)**

#### Formative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 min)

**Distribute exit ticket** (See Attachment C) with these questions:

1. **Identify:** Draw and label one aquatic insect (nymph or adult)
2. **Explain:** Why do insects hatch at specific times?
3. **Connect:** How does this knowledge help anglers?
4. **Reflect:** What was most interesting to you today?

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **4 (Advanced)** - Accurate drawing, detailed explanation, makes connections
- **3 (Proficient)** - Correct identification, adequate explanation
- **2 (Developing)** - Some understanding, needs more detail

## 👨‍🏫 Teacher Notes & Tips

### What Works Well
✅ **Specimens are gold** - If you can get preserved insects, do it! Students remember hands-on.  
✅ **Real flies** - Borrow fishing flies from local shop to show imit itations  
✅ **Relate to fishing** - Even non-anglers find it interesting  
✅ **App makes it stick** - Gamification boosts engagement  
✅ **Build to field trip** - Students are excited to find real insects after this lesson

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: "I don't fish, how can I teach this?"**
- **Solution:** You don't need to be an angler! Focus on the biology and ecology. The app guides the fishing connections. Emphasize you're all learning together.

**Challenge 2: "Students get stuck on app quiz"**
- **Solution:** 
  - Enable hint feature
  - Remind them to check water temperature first (biggest clue)
  - Pair struggling students with successful ones
  - It's okay to not get 100% - process matters more than score

**Challenge 3: "We don't have specimens"**
- **Solution:** 
  - Use app images exclusively (works fine!)
  - Consider field trip to collect insects
  - Borrow from science department
  - Order preserved specimens online (~$20 for set)

**Challenge 4: "Class gets too excited/loud during app time"**
- **Solution:**
  - Set noise level expectations beforehand
  - Use timer: "3 minutes of quiet exploration, then discuss"
  - Allow some excitement - it means engagement!
  - Redirect: "Use that energy to help a classmate"

**Challenge 5: "Some students finish way before others"**
- **Solution:**
  - Have extension activities ready:
    - Explore other sections of fishing guide
    - Research one insect in depth
    - Help slower students (teaching solidifies learning)
    - Start homework assignment early

### Time Management

**If you're SHORT on time (30-minute class):**
1. Skip KWL chart - just verbal Q&A (2 min)
2. Focus on Big 3 insects only (8 min)
3. Brief emergence explanation (5 min)
4. Jump straight to app (10 min)
5. Quick exit ticket (5 min)

**If you have EXTRA time (90-minute block):**
1. Do full lesson as written (45 min)
2. ADD:
   - Detailed insect dissection (if specimens available)
   - Stream video analysis (watch footage, identify insects)
   - Fly tying demonstration
   - Guest speaker (virtual or in-person)
   - Start homework in class

**Ideal pacing:**
- Don't rush the app activity - that's where learning solidifies
- The exploration time is when "aha!" moments happen
- Better to skip some lecture than cut hands-on time

### Technology Troubleshooting

**Issue: App won't load**
- Check Wi-Fi connection
- Refresh browser/restart app
- Use offline mode (if content pre-downloaded)
- Have backup: printable field guide

**Issue: Student forgot login**
- Use class code to re-join
- Reset password via email
- Contact tech support: support@wildpraxis.org

**Issue: Not all students have devices**
- Pair students (actually enhances collaboration!)
- Use classroom computer lab
- Project on screen for whole-class version
- Provide printable alternative

### Safety Considerations

**In Classroom:**
- If using preserved specimens: some contain formaldehyde - use in ventilated area, wash hands after
- Allergies: ask about insect allergies before bringing live specimens
- Microscope safety: no running, one person at a time

**If Extending to Field:**
- See Attachment B for full field trip safety plan
- Never let students in water above ankle depth without waders
- Buddy system always
- First aid kit
- Check for poison ivy, ticks
- Sun protection
