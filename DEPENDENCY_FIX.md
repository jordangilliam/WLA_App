# 🔧 Final Dependency Fix - @auth/core Conflict

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Peer Dependency Conflict

### What Went Wrong?

You had both `next-auth` AND `@auth/core` in your dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "next-auth": "^4.24.7",
  "@auth/core": "^0.18.4",  ← This is the problem!
}
```

**The Problem:**
- `@auth/core` is a **peer dependency** of `next-auth`
- It should NOT be listed separately
- `next-auth` manages its own version of `@auth/core`
- Having both causes version conflicts

**The Error:**
```
next-auth@4.24.11 wants @auth/core@0.34.2
But you have @auth/core@0.18.4
CONFLICT!
```

---

## 🔨 The Fix

**Removed `@auth/core` from dependencies:**

```json
"dependencies": {
  "next": "14.2.4",
  "react": "18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "18.3.1",
  "next-auth": "^4.24.7",  ← Will manage @auth/core itself
  "mapbox-gl": "^3.6.0",
  "zod": "^3.23.8",
  "uuid": "^9.0.1"
}
```

## 📤 Upload to GitHub

**Replace your `package.json` with the fixed version:**

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/jordangilliam/WLA_App
2. **Click on:** `package.json`
3. **Click:** ✏️ Edit icon
4. **Replace entire content with the fixed version**
5. **Commit message:** `Fix @auth/core dependency conflict`
6. **Click:** "Commit changes"

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
```
❌ @auth/core@0.18.4 (your version)
❌ next-auth wants @auth/core@0.34.2
❌ CONFLICT → Build fails
```

### After (Fixed):
```
✅ next-auth@4.24.7
✅ Automatically includes @auth/core@0.34.2
✅ No conflicts → Build succeeds!
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After uploading the fixed `package.json`:

1. **GitHub Actions will run**
2. **npm install will succeed**
3. **No dependency conflicts**
4. **Build completes**
5. **Ready to deploy!**

## 🎓 Lesson Learned

### Peer Dependencies vs Regular Dependencies

**Regular Dependency:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "next": "14.2.4"  ← You install this
}
```

**Peer Dependency:**
```json
// Inside next-auth's package.json
"peerDependencies": {
  "@auth/core": "0.34.2"  ← next-auth needs this
}
```

**Rule:** 
- ❌ Don't list peer dependencies in your package.json
- ✅ Let the parent package manage them

---

## 🔍 Other Common Peer Dependency Issues

If you see similar errors:

### Pattern:
```
Could not resolve dependency:
peer [package]@"version" from [parent-package]
```

### Solution:
1. Check if you have `[package]` in your dependencies
2. Remove it if it's a peer dependency
3. Let the parent package manage it

### Examples:
- `@auth/core` → managed by `next-auth` ✅
- `react` → you install it directly ✅
- `react-dom` → you install it directly ✅

---

## 🆘 If This Still Doesn't Work

### Nuclear Option: Use --legacy-peer-deps

Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts.

**But try the fix above first!** It's the proper solution.
