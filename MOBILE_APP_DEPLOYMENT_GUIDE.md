## 🛠️ Recommended Approach: React Native

### Why React Native?

**Code Reuse:**
- 80-90% code sharing between iOS and Android
- Can share business logic with PWA
- Single development team for all platforms
- Faster development than separate native apps

**Performance:**
- Near-native performance
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Efficient memory usage
- Fast startup time

**Ecosystem:**
- Massive library of pre-built components
- Active community support
- Backed by Facebook/Meta
- Used by Instagram, Walmart, Microsoft

**Cost-Effective:**
- One codebase vs two (Swift + Kotlin)
- Shorter development time
- Lower maintenance burden
- Easier to find developers
