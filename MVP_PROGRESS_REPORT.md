## 💡 TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data
- **JSONB** for flexible activity data
- **Views** for complex queries (performance)
- **Triggers** for automatic logging
- **Functions** for common operations

### Authentication
- **NextAuth** with enhanced session
- **Role-based access** (student, teacher, parent, admin)
- **Class codes** for easy enrollment

### Type Safety
- **TypeScript** throughout
- **Strict types** for all DB entities
- **DTO types** for API requests
- **Response types** for API responses

### API Design
- **RESTful** conventions
- **Consistent response format** (ApiResponse<T>)
- **Proper HTTP status codes**
- **Error handling** standardized

## 🚀 MOMENTUM

We've built an INCREDIBLE foundation today:

✅ **Comprehensive planning** (140+ pages of documentation)
✅ **Complete database design** (12 tables, views, functions)
✅ **Full type system** (50+ interfaces)
✅ **First API routes** working
✅ **Clear 11-week roadmap**

**This is ready for rapid development!**

Everything is architected, typed, and documented. Now it's just building out the planned features one by one. The hardest part (design and planning) is done!

## 📞 READY FOR NEXT STEPS

**Questions for you:**

1. **Do you want to deploy the database schema now?**
   - Need database credentials
   - Or should we continue with mock data for now?

2. **Priority for next session:**
   - Continue API routes?
   - Start teacher dashboard UI?
   - Begin compliance docs?
   - Write first lesson plan?

3. **Timeline:**
   - Can we maintain this pace for 11 weeks?
   - Any adjustments to the schedule?
   - Any features to add/remove?

**I'm ready to keep building! What should I focus on next?** 🚀
