DEPLOYMENT STATUS SUMMARY
==============================================

CURRENT SITUATION:
------------------
✓ All component files exist locally
✓ All component files are in Git commit e7f8c4d
✓ GitHub has commit e7f8c4d with all files
✓ Netlify is configured with all environment variables
✓ netlify.toml has correct build settings
✗ Netlify build fails - can't find the files!

This is a very unusual situation where everything
is configured correctly but the build still fails.


VERIFIED FACTS:
===============
1. Files exist:
   - ui/points/PointsProvider.tsx ✓
   - lib/data/conservation-history.ts ✓
   - components/ConservationHistory.tsx ✓
   - components/LocalHistoryResearch.tsx ✓
   - components/dashboard/TeacherNav.tsx ✓

2. Commit e7f8c4d contains all files ✓

3. GitHub has commit e7f8c4d ✓

4. Netlify clones from GitHub ✓

5. But Netlify can't resolve the @/ path aliases!


LIKELY CAUSE:
=============
The issue might be with TypeScript path aliases (@/)
not being resolved correctly by Next.js during build.

Check tsconfig.json for paths configuration.


IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:
===================
Since we've spent hours on deployment issues,
I recommend building locally and deploying the
pre-built files:

1. Build locally:
   .\node-portable\npm.cmd run build

2. This creates .next folder

3. Deploy pre-built:
   .\node-portable\npx.cmd netlify deploy --dir=.next --prod

This skips the build step entirely and uploads
the working build from your local machine.


TIME SPENT ON DEPLOYMENT:
==========================
- Vercel environment variable issues: 3+ hours
- Netlify build issues: 30+ minutes
- Total: 3.5+ hours

At this point, deploying pre-built files is
the fastest path to getting your app live.
