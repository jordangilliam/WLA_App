WILDPRAXIS - SIMPLE NEXT STEPS
============================================

WHAT WE JUST DID:
✅ Set up Node.js (portable version, no install needed)
✅ Installed Supabase (database software)
✅ All code is ready to go!

============================================

WHAT TO DO NEXT:

OPTION 1: SET UP DATABASE (2-3 hours)
---------------------------------------------
1. Go to supabase.com
2. Click "Start your project" (free)
3. Create new project (takes 2 minutes)
4. Get your codes (looks like long passwords)
5. Paste them into a file called ".env.local"

Full instructions: See SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md


OPTION 2: REVIEW & UNDERSTAND (30 min)
---------------------------------------------
Read these files to understand what was built:
- PHASE1-FOUNDATION-COMPLETE.md (start here!)
- SESSION-SUMMARY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md


OPTION 3: TAKE A BREAK
---------------------------------------------
Everything is saved. Come back anytime!

============================================

HOW TO RUN YOUR APP:

.\node-portable\npm.cmd run dev

(Then open browser to: http://localhost:3000)

To stop: Press Ctrl+C

============================================

FILES TO READ:
- SETUP-COMPLETE-NEXT-STEPS.md (detailed version)
- SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md (for database)
- PHASE1-FOUNDATION-COMPLETE.md (overview)

============================================

YOU'RE READY! 🚀

The technical setup is complete.
Next is connecting a database (optional but recommended).
