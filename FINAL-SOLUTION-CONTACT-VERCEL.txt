VERCEL DATABASE CORRUPTION - CONTACT SUPPORT
==============================================

SITUATION:
----------
Your Vercel project has a database corruption issue.

Evidence:
- vercel env ls shows: "Encrypted" (correct plaintext)
- vercel deploy says: "references Secret" (wrong!)

This means Vercel's database has conflicting/duplicate
entries for the same variable.


SOLUTION: Contact Vercel Support
=================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/help

2. Click "Contact Support"

3. Subject: "Environment variable database corruption"

4. Message:

---
Hello,

My project (jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app) has a 
database corruption issue with environment variables.

When I run `vercel env ls`, variables show as "Encrypted"
(plaintext values), but when I deploy, I get this error:

"Environment Variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL references 
Secret supabase_url, which does not exist."

I have:
- Deleted and recreated the project
- Removed and re-added all environment variables
- Verified variables are NOT set to "Sensitive"
- Variables show as "Encrypted" in CLI but deploy fails

Project ID: [get from Vercel dashboard settings]
Team: jordan-gilliams-projects

Please help clear the database corruption so my 
environment variables work correctly.

Thank you!

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND: Build Locally, Deploy Static
===================================================

While waiting for Vercel support, you can:

1. Build locally:
   .\node-portable\npm.cmd run build

2. This creates a .next folder with static files

3. Deploy the pre-built files instead of building on Vercel


ALTERNATIVE: Try Different Platform
====================================

If you need to deploy TODAY, consider:

1. Netlify (free tier, similar to Vercel)
2. Railway (one-click Next.js deploy)
3. Render (free tier)

All support Next.js and have better env var UIs.


I'M SORRY THIS HAPPENED
========================

This is a bug in Vercel's system, not your fault.
The environment variables ARE configured correctly,
but Vercel's database has corrupted/duplicate entries.

Vercel support should be able to fix this quickly.
