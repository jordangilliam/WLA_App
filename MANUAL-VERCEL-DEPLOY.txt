MANUALLY TRIGGER VERCEL DEPLOYMENT
==============================================

GitHub push succeeded, but Vercel isn't auto-deploying.
Here's how to trigger it manually:


METHOD 1: Vercel Dashboard (EASIEST)
--------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordangilliam/wla-app

2. Click the "Deployments" tab

3. Look for a button that says "Deploy" or "Create Deployment"
   - OR click "..." menu on any deployment → "Redeploy"

4. Make sure it's using the LATEST commit:
   - Commit: 33e87b4
   - Message: "Add missing component files for deployment"

5. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"


METHOD 2: Check GitHub Integration
-----------------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordangilliam/wla-app/settings/git

2. Make sure:
   - ✅ GitHub is connected
   - ✅ Repository: jordangilliam/WLA_App
   - ✅ Production Branch: main
   - ✅ "Automatically deploy" is enabled

3. If not enabled, click "Connect" or "Enable"


METHOD 3: Force Deploy via Git
-------------------------------
If all else fails, make a tiny change and push:

1. In your terminal:
   echo "# Deploy test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Trigger Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main

2. Wait 30 seconds, check Vercel dashboard


WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
------------------
In Vercel dashboard, you should see:
- Status: "Building" or "Ready"
- Commit: 33e87b4 (latest)
- Time: Just now (within last minute)


LATEST COMMIT INFO:
-------------------
Commit: 33e87b4
Message: "Add missing component files for deployment"
Files: 5 missing components added
- ui/points/PointsProvider.tsx
- lib/data/conservation-history.ts
- components/ConservationHistory.tsx
- components/LocalHistoryResearch.tsx
- components/dashboard/TeacherNav.tsx


IF STILL NOT WORKING:
---------------------
The Vercel CLI approach might work better:

1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already):
   .\node-portable\npm.cmd install -g vercel

2. Login and deploy:
   .\node-portable\npx.cmd vercel login
   .\node-portable\npx.cmd vercel --prod
