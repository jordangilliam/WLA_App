## Notes

### TypeScript Warnings
- All pages have TypeScript strict mode warnings (implicitly 'any' types, missing JSX declarations)
- These are **non-breaking** - code is functional
- Consistent with existing project structure
- Can be resolved with explicit type annotations if desired

### Browser Compatibility
- Photo upload: All modern browsers (FileReader API)
- Audio recording: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (MediaRecorder API)
- May need microphone permissions
- GPS: Works on mobile and desktop with location services

### Performance
- localStorage has 5-10MB limit (varies by browser)
- Large photo collections may need cleanup
- Consider compression for production
- Audio files are relatively small (WebM format)
