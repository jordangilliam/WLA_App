**Solution**: Say "Make it more realistic, like a scientific field guide illustration"

### **Issue: Colors too bright**
**Solution**: Say "Use more muted natural earth tones, like vintage watercolors"

### **Issue: Background too busy**
**Solution**: Say "Simplify the background, keep focus on the [animal]"

### **Issue: Not enough detail**
**Solution**: Say "Add more detail to the [fur/feathers/scales], make it field guide quality"
