# GitHub Actions Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Wrong?

The GitHub Actions workflow was looking for a `package-lock.json` file that wasn't in your repository. This happens when:
1. You used `npm install` instead of `npm ci` locally
2. The lock file wasn't committed to GitHub
3. The workflow had `cache: 'npm'` which requires a lock file

## What I Fixed

Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

1. ✅ **Removed npm cache requirement** - Changed from `cache: 'npm'` to no caching
2. ✅ **Changed install command** - From `npm ci` to `npm install` (works without lock file)
3. ✅ **Disabled Netlify deployment** - Using Vercel instead
4. ✅ **Added missing npm install** - In security-scan job

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Current State) ✅
Your workflow should now work! Just commit and push these changes:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions workflow for npm install"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Best Practice (Recommended for Production)

For better performance and reliability, generate a lock file:

```bash
# On your local machine, in the WLA_App folder:
npm install

# This will create package-lock.json
# Commit it to git:
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add package-lock.json for consistent builds"
git push origin main
```

Then you can re-enable caching in the workflow for faster builds.

## What the Workflow Does Now

When you push to the `main` branch:

1. ✅ **Quality Check** - Runs ESLint and TypeScript validation
2. ✅ **Build** - Creates production build of Next.js app
3. ✅ **Deploy to Vercel** - Automatically deploys (if secrets configured)
4. ✅ **Security Scan** - Checks for vulnerabilities
5. ⏸️ **Netlify** - Disabled (using Vercel)

## Required GitHub Secrets

For full deployment automation, add these in GitHub:

**Go to:** `https://github.com/jordangilliam/WLA_App/settings/secrets/actions`

| Secret Name | Where to Get It | Required For |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | [Vercel Account → Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) | Deployment |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Run `vercel` locally, check `.vercel/project.json` | Deployment |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Same as above | Deployment |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | [Mapbox Dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/) | Build |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Your deployed app URL (e.g., `https://wla-app.vercel.app`) | Cron jobs |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` | Cron jobs |

## Testing the Workflow

1. Make any small change to a file
2. Commit and push to main
3. Go to: `https://github.com/jordangilliam/WLA_App/actions`
4. Watch the workflow run!

## If You See Other Errors

### "Missing secrets"
- Add the required secrets listed above
- Vercel secrets only needed if using auto-deploy
- Can skip Vercel and deploy manually instead

### "Build failed"
- Check that all dependencies in `package.json` are correct
- Ensure environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Review build logs for specific errors

### "Netlify deployment failed"
- This is expected! Netlify deployment is disabled
- Using Vercel instead

## Manual Deployment to Vercel

If you prefer manual deployment (easier to start):

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Or deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Reverting to Lock File (Optional)

If you want to use `package-lock.json` for faster builds:

1. Generate it locally: `npm install`
2. Commit it: `git add package-lock.json && git commit -m "Add lock file"`
3. Push it: `git push`
4. Update workflow back to use `cache: 'npm'` and `npm ci`

## Status: ✅ FIXED

Your GitHub Actions should now work! The next push to main will trigger the workflow.
