NUCLEAR OPTION - DELETE PROJECT & START FRESH
==============================================

The environment variables are completely corrupted.
The fastest solution is to DELETE the Vercel project
and import fresh from GitHub.

This will take 5 minutes total.


STEP 1: Delete the Vercel Project
----------------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app/settings

2. Scroll to bottom: "Delete Project"

3. Type the project name: wla-app

4. Click "Delete"


STEP 2: Import Fresh from GitHub
---------------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new

2. Click "Import Project"

3. Under "Import Git Repository":
   - Select GitHub

   - Click "Import"

4. Configure:
   - Project Name: wla-app
   - Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: ./
   - Click "Deploy" (will fail - that's OK!)


STEP 3: Add Environment Variables (Fresh)
------------------------------------------
After deploy fails:

1. Go to: Settings → Environment Variables

2. Add these 14 variables ONE BY ONE:
   (Use Key/Value fields, check Production)

   1. NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://vaqcsbneypmdhrqnnjph.supabase.co
   2. NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = (from Supabase)
   3. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = (from Supabase)
   4. NEXTAUTH_URL = https://wla-app.vercel.app
   5. NEXTAUTH_SECRET = sQRBPk1xTj+gtcmj6hiAXZqFCUT+FDwLQ/oMFp73lcs=
   6. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = (from YOUR-STRIPE-KEYS.txt)
   7. NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = (from YOUR-STRIPE-KEYS.txt)
   8. STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = (from YOUR-STRIPE-KEYS.txt)
   9. STRIPE_PRICE_SCHOOL_BASIC = price_1SR0V1Lxnej9R7UU8Sc99IJr
   10. STRIPE_PRICE_SCHOOL_PRO = price_1SR0VPLxnej9R7UUu72O5kB1
   11. STRIPE_PRICE_SCHOOL_UNLIMITED = price_1SR0VqLxnej9R7UUUTiPYQdd
   12. STRIPE_PRICE_DISTRICT = price_1SR0WlLxnej9R7UULmdjGR6d
   13. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION = 1.0.0
   14. NODE_ENV = production


STEP 4: Redeploy
----------------
1. Go to: Deployments tab

2. Click "Redeploy" on the failed deployment

3. Wait 2-3 minutes

4. Visit: https://wla-app.vercel.app
