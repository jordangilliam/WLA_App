==============================================
DEPLOY VIA VERCEL WEBSITE - FASTEST METHOD
==============================================

The CLI has issues. Use the website instead - it's faster!


STEP 1: Go to Vercel Project Settings
--------------------------------------
https://vercel.com/jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app/settings/environment-variables

You should see ONLY:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN

If you see ANY other variables, DELETE THEM ALL.


STEP 2: Add Variables via Website (NOT CLI!)
---------------------------------------------
For EACH variable below, click "Add New" button:

1. Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   Value: https://vaqcsbneypmdhrqnnjph.supabase.co
   Environment: Production (check the box)
   Click "Save"

2. Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   Value: (paste from your .env.local file)
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

3. Key: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

4. Key: NEXTAUTH_URL
   Value: https://wla-app.vercel.app
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

5. Key: NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   Value: (paste from your .env.local file)
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

6. Key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   Value: (paste from YOUR-STRIPE-KEYS.txt)
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

7. Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   Value: (paste from YOUR-STRIPE-KEYS.txt)
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

8. Key: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   Value: (paste from YOUR-STRIPE-KEYS.txt)
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

9. Key: STRIPE_PRICE_SCHOOL_BASIC
   Value: price_1SR0V1Lxnej9R7UU8Sc99IJr
   Environment: Production
   Click "Save"

10. Key: STRIPE_PRICE_SCHOOL_PRO
    Value: price_1SR0VPLxnej9R7UUu72O5kB1
    Environment: Production
    Click "Save"

11. Key: STRIPE_PRICE_SCHOOL_UNLIMITED
    Value: price_1SR0VqLxnej9R7UUUTiPYQdd
    Environment: Production
    Click "Save"

12. Key: STRIPE_PRICE_DISTRICT
    Value: price_1SR0WlLxnej9R7UULmdjGR6d
    Environment: Production
    Click "Save"

13. Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION
    Value: 1.0.0
    Environment: Production
    Click "Save"

14. Key: NODE_ENV
    Value: production
    Environment: Production
    Click "Save"


STEP 3: Deploy via Website
---------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app

2. Click "Deployments" tab

3. Click "Deploy" button (or "Redeploy" on latest)

4. Make sure it says: "Branch: main"

5. Make sure it says: "Commit: 0812205" or later

6. Click "Deploy" button

7. WAIT for build to complete (2-3 minutes)


STEP 4: Check Build Logs
-------------------------
Watch the build logs in real-time.

If it STILL shows the secret error, there's a project
configuration issue that needs to be reset.


ALTERNATIVE IF STILL FAILS:
---------------------------
Delete the entire Vercel project and reimport from GitHub:

1. Project Settings → General → Delete Project
2. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
3. Import: jordangilliam/WLA_App
4. Add all 14 environment variables
5. Deploy

This will give you a completely fresh start.
