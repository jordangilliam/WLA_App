## 🏗️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### PWA Architecture:

```
/public/
├── sw.js              ← Service Worker (offline caching)
├── manifest.json      ← PWA config (installability)
└── icons-readme.md    ← Icon guidelines

/components/
└── PWAInstall.tsx     ← Install prompt & offline indicator

/app/
└── layout.tsx         ← Updated with PWA metadata
```

### Caching Strategy:

**Network-First (HTML):**
- Fetches fresh content when online
- Falls back to cache if offline
- Updates cache with new content

**Cache-First (Assets):**
- Serves from cache immediately
- Updates in background
- Ensures fast loading

**Precached URLs:**
```
/ (home)
/learn
/habitat
/journal
/map
/birds
/keys/macro
/outreach
/leaderboard
/manifest.json
```

✅ Responsive grid layouts
✅ Camera/photo integration
✅ GPS location capture
✅ Offline data storage (localStorage)
✅ Install as home screen app

✅ Auto-save functionality

### Field Scenarios:
1. **Stream Survey**: Use Macro ID and Journal offline
2. **Bird Watching**: Record songs, GPS locations work
3. **Habitat Assessment**: Build designs, data persists
4. **Event Tracking**: RSVP and log completion
5. **Learning**: Access lessons, quizzes work offline
