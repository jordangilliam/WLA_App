POTENTIAL SOLUTION - GITHUB OUT OF SYNC
==============================================

The component files exist locally but Netlify can't find them.
This suggests GitHub's repository doesn't have them.

This likely happened because many of your git pushes
were REJECTED by GitHub (due to Stripe secrets), so
some commits never made it to GitHub.


SOLUTION: Manual Verification
==============================

STEP 1: Check GitHub Website
-----------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/jordangilliam/WLA_App

2. Click on these paths and verify files exist:
   - ui/points/PointsProvider.tsx
   - lib/data/conservation-history.ts
   - components/ConservationHistory.tsx
   - components/LocalHistoryResearch.tsx
   - components/dashboard/TeacherNav.tsx

3. If ANY are missing - that's the problem!


STEP 2: If Files Are Missing on GitHub
---------------------------------------
The commits with these files never made it to GitHub.

We need to re-commit them:

In PowerShell:
git add ui/ lib/data/ components/
git commit -m "Add all missing component files"
git push origin main --force


STEP 3: Verify on GitHub
-------------------------
After pushing, go back to GitHub website and
verify all 5 files now exist.


ALTERNATIVE: Deploy Pre-Built Version
======================================

If you need the site live TODAY, build locally:

1. .\node-portable\npm.cmd run build

2. This creates .next folder

3. Use `netlify deploy --dir=.next --prod`

This uploads pre-built files, skipping the
build step entirely.
