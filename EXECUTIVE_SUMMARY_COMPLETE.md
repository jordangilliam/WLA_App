## Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Grant Funding Not Secured**
- Mitigation: Bootstrap with pilot school revenue
- Plan B: Slower development timeline, PWA-only approach
- Timeline: Delay mobile apps by 6-12 months

**Risk 2: WLA Partnership Doesn't Materialize**
- Mitigation: Have demonstrated value and other school pilots
- Plan B: Direct school sales without WLA referrals
- Impact: Slower growth but still viable

**Risk 3: Low School Adoption**
- Mitigation: Free trials, pilot pricing, strong demos
- Plan B: Focus on state agency contracts (larger deals)
- Pivot: Consider direct-to-consumer model

**Risk 4: Technical Challenges with Mobile Apps**
- Mitigation: Experienced React Native developers
- Plan B: Continue with PWA, add Capacitor wrapper
- Fallback: Native development (more expensive)

**Risk 5: Competitive Response**
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage, partnerships
- Differentiation: Pennsylvania focus, comprehensiveness
- Barrier to entry: Relationships, curriculum integration

**Risk 6: Regulatory Changes (COPPA, FERPA)**
- Mitigation: Legal review, compliance from day one
- Monitoring: Stay current on regulations
- Insurance: Cyber liability and E&O insurance
