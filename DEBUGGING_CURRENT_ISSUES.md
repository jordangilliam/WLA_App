# 🔧 Debugging Current Issues - Quick Guide

## ✅ **What I Just Fixed**

### 1. Lesson Not Found Issue
**Problem:** URLs with `&` characters broke lesson loading
**Solution:** Added proper URL encoding/decoding
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Pushed to GitHub

---

## 🐛 **Remaining Issues to Debug**

### Issue 1: Homepage Looks Empty (Only Emojis Visible)

#### **Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (Press F12)

2. **Check Console Tab:**
   ```
   Look for errors like:
   - "Failed to load resource"
   - "TypeError: Cannot read property"
   - CSS or JS loading errors
   ```

3. **Check Elements Tab:**
   - Right-click on empty area → "Inspect"
   - Is the HTML there but not visible?
   - Are styles being applied?

4. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Refresh page
   - Look for red (failed) requests
   - Check if CSS files loaded (200 status)

#### **Possible Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause A: CSS Not Loading**
```
If you see 404 for CSS files:
→ Check styles/globals.css exists
→ Check it's imported in layout.tsx
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

**Cause B: Content Rendering but Invisible**
```
If HTML exists in Elements tab but not visible:
→ Check for CSS conflicts
→ Check display/visibility properties
→ Try adding inline style="color: red" to test
```

**Cause C: JavaScript Error Preventing Render**
```
If console shows errors:
→ Read error message carefully
→ Note file and line number
→ Fix that specific error first
```

### Issue 2: Lessons Should Load Now (After Fix)

#### **Test This:**

1. Go to `/learn` page
2. Click any lesson
3. Should now load properly

**If still broken:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)  
- Wait 2-3 min for deployment
- Try incognito mode

---

## 🧪 **Testing Protocol**

### **After Each Fix:**

1. **Local Test**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Test in browser at localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Check for Errors**
   - Console (F12)
   - No red errors
   - No warnings (if possible)

3. **Test Core Flow**
   - Can you navigate?
   - Can you click lessons?
   - Can you complete quiz?
   - Are points awarded?

4. **Commit if Working**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Description of what you fixed"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🔍 **Systematic Debugging Approach**

### **Step 1: Reproduce the Issue**
- What exact steps cause the problem?
- Does it happen every time?
- Does it happen in incognito mode?

### **Step 2: Isolate the Cause**
- Comment out code sections
- Test with minimal code
- Binary search (disable half, test, repeat)

### **Step 3: Read Error Messages**
```
Error: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
       at LessonList.tsx:45

Translation:
- Something is undefined
- You're trying to call .map() on it
- It's in LessonList.tsx at line 45
- Check what variable is undefined there
```

### **Step 4: Fix Small, Test Often**
- Change ONE thing
- Test immediately
- If broken, undo
- If working, commit

### **Step 5: Prevent Recurrence**
- Add validation
- Add error handling
- Add TypeScript types
- Add comments

Here's line 10:
const lesson = lessons.find(l => l.id === id);

The 'lessons' variable seems to be undefined."
```
