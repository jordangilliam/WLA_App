- [ ] You should see a workflow running
- [ ] It should complete successfully (green checkmark)
- [ ] No "package-lock.json not found" error

## 🔧 GitHub Secrets to Add (Optional - For Auto-Deploy)

To enable automatic deployment to Vercel, add these secrets:

**Go to:** `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `New repository secret`

| Secret Name | Description | Required |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | From [Vercel Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) | For auto-deploy |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | From `.vercel/project.json` after running `vercel` locally | For auto-deploy |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Same as above | For auto-deploy |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | From [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/) | For builds |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Your app URL (e.g., `https://wla-app.vercel.app`) | For cron jobs |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Generate: `openssl rand -hex 32` | For cron jobs |

**Note:** You can skip the secrets and deploy manually to Vercel instead!

---

## 🎯 Manual Deployment to Vercel (Recommended to Start)

Instead of configuring GitHub secrets, deploy manually:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (first time - will ask questions)
vercel

# Future deployments
vercel --prod
```

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Add environment variables from `.env.template`
2. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your Vercel URL
3. Configure custom domain (optional)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### DO NOT Upload These Files
- ❌ `.env.local` (contains secrets - never commit!)
- ❌ `node_modules/` (too large, regenerated on install)
- ❌ `.next/` (build output, regenerated)
- ❌ `.vercel/` (local deployment cache)

These are already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental upload.

### File Encoding
- All files are UTF-8 encoded
- Line endings: LF (Unix-style) - GitHub will handle this

---

## 🎉 What Happens After Upload

1. **GitHub Actions will trigger** and run your workflow
2. **Build process** will create production bundle
3. **Tests** will run (if configured)
4. **Deployment** will start (if Vercel secrets configured)
5. You'll see results in the Actions tab

### If Deployment Fails
- Don't worry! It's likely just missing secrets
- Deploy manually to Vercel instead
- Check `GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIX.md` for troubleshooting

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Workflow Errors
- Check: `https://github.com/jordangilliam/WLA_App/actions`
