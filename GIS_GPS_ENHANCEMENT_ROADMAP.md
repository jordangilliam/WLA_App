## 🚀 Ready to Start?

**I recommend starting with Option A (Trout Stocking)** because:
1. Fastest to implement (uses existing map)
2. Highest immediate value
3. Engages PA fishing community
4. Builds momentum for other features

Would you like me to begin building the fishing/trout stocking integration?
