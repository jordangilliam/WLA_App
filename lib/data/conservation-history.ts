      significance: "Humans struggle to accept predators, even as we recognize their ecological importance. Fear and livestock losses create resistance to predator recovery."

    "**Climate Change**: Warming favors southern species (armadillos moving north) but threatens cold-adapted species.",
    "**Invasive Species**: Feral hogs not yet in PA but threaten from surrounding states. Would devastate ecosystems.",
    "**Declining Hunters**: Fewer hunters means less funding for conservation and less population control for deer.",
    "**Tick-Borne Diseases**: Lyme, anaplasmosis, babesiosis spreading. Linked to deer abundance and climate warming.",
    "**Forest Health**: Deer overbrowsing, invasive insects, and disease threaten forests that wildlife depend on."
