## üéØ PRIORITY 1: EDUCATOR DASHBOARD & CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks | **Impact:** CRITICAL | **Complexity:** HIGH

### Why This Matters Most:
- Schools won't adopt without teacher oversight
- Youth programs need participant tracking
- WLA needs cohort management for academies
- Liability requires adult supervision features

### Core Features Needed:

#### 1. Teacher/Leader Dashboard
```typescript
// Teacher view of all students/participants
- Class roster management (add/remove students)
- Real-time activity monitoring (who's active, when, where)
- Progress tracking per student (badges earned, lessons completed)
- Safety alerts (location-based notifications if enabled)
- Assignment creation and tracking
- Gradebook integration
- Parent communication tools
```

#### 2. Student Account Management
```typescript
// School-safe authentication
- District SSO integration (Google, Microsoft, Clever)
- Parental consent workflows (COPPA compliant)
- Age-gated features (13+ vs under 13)
- Privacy controls (location sharing opt-in)
- Bulk student imports (CSV upload)
- Class codes for easy enrollment
```

#### 3. Group/Cohort Features
```typescript
// For WLA cohorts, field trips, classes
- Create groups (e.g., "Spring 2025 Fishing Academy")
- Group challenges (compete as teams)
- Shared observations (class field trip data)
- Group leaderboards (friendly competition)
- Scheduled activities (calendar integration)
- Attendance tracking (for in-person events)
```

#### 4. Activity Monitoring & Safety
```typescript
// Peace of mind for administrators
- Live activity feed per class
- Location sharing (opt-in, session-based only)
- Inappropriate content flagging
- Time-on-task reports
- Completion rates dashboard
- Safety incident reporting
```

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Basic teacher dashboard (week 1-2)
2. Class roster management (week 2)
3. Progress tracking (week 3)
4. Group features (week 4)
5. SSO integration (week 5-6)

## üéØ PRIORITY 2: CURRICULUM PACKAGES & LESSON PLANS
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks | **Impact:** CRITICAL | **Complexity:** MEDIUM

### Why This Matters:
- Teachers need "plug-and-play" lessons (they're overwhelmed)
- Schools require standards alignment documentation
- Grant proposals need curriculum frameworks
- Substitute teachers need clear instructions

### What to Build:

#### 1. Structured Lesson Plans (12-15 total)
**Format per lesson:**

## üéØ PRIORITY 3: COMPLIANCE & SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks | **Impact:** CRITICAL | **Complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH

### Why This Matters:
- Schools CANNOT adopt without COPPA/FERPA compliance
- Liability concerns block youth program use
- Grant funding requires privacy documentation
- App store approval requires safety features

### Must-Have Features:

#### 1. COPPA Compliance (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
```typescript
// For users under 13
interface COPPACompliance {
  parentalConsent: {
    required: true,
    methods: ['email verification', 'paper form upload', 'digital signature'],
    retention: 'permanent record',
    revokable: true
  },
  dataCollection: {
    minimized: true, // Only collect what's necessary
    noAdvertising: true,
    noLocationWithoutConsent: true,
    noPersistentIdentifiers: false, // Need for progress tracking
    parentalAccess: true // Parents can view/delete data
  },
  verification: {
    ageGate: 'on signup',
    schoolVerification: 'via domain or class code',
    parentalEmail: 'required for under 13'
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Age gate on signup
- Parental consent workflow (email verification + digital signature)
- Separate "under 13" mode (no social features, no location sharing)
- Parental dashboard (view child's activity, delete data)
- Privacy policy in plain language (6th grade reading level)

#### 2. FERPA Compliance (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
```typescript
// For school districts
interface FERPACompliance {
  educationalRecords: {
    secure: true,
    encryptedAtRest: true,
    encryptedInTransit: true,
    accessControls: 'role-based',
    auditLogs: 'all access logged'
  },
  dataSharing: {
    thirdParty: false, // No selling data
    marketingOptOut: true,
    parentalControl: 'full access',
    districtControl: 'full ownership'
  },
  dataRetention: {
    studentData: 'retained until graduation + 1 year',
    deletionRequests: 'processed within 30 days',
    exportable: 'full data export on request'
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- District Data Processing Agreement (DPA) template
- Student data encryption (AES-256)
- No third-party analytics on student accounts
- Annual security audits
- Incident response plan

#### 3. Safety Features
```typescript
interface SafetyFeatures {
  contentModeration: {
    imageUpload: 'teacher approval required',
    textFiltering: 'profanity filter + manual review',
    flaggingSystem: 'students can report inappropriate content',
    teacherAlerts: 'instant notification of flags'
  },
  locationPrivacy: {
    defaultOff: true,
    sessionBased: true, // Only during active field trip
    teacherControlled: true,
    neverPublic: true,
    autoExpire: '24 hours after session'
  },
  communication: {
    studentToStudent: false, // No direct messaging
    studentToTeacher: 'yes, logged and monitored',
    publicProfiles: false,
    anonymousLeaderboard: 'option for initials only'
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Content moderation queue for teacher review
- Location sharing: opt-in, time-limited, teacher-controlled
- No student-to-student messaging (safety liability)
- Teacher-student communication logged
- Emergency contact info collection

#### 4. Digital Citizenship Integration
