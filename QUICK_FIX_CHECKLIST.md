## 🚀 After Successful Deployment

### 1. Add Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these (from `.env.template`):

**Required:**
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**For Maps:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your-mapbox-token
```

**For Authentication:**
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-client-id
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-secret
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=common
```

**For Admin Access:**
```env
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-admin-email@example.com
ADMIN_DOMAINS=wildlifeleadershipacademy.org
```

### 2. Update OAuth Redirect URIs

**Google Cloud Console:**
- Add: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google`

**Azure Portal:**
- Add: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`

### 3. Test Your App

Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Points system works
- ✅ Sign in works (after OAuth setup)
- ✅ Map loads (after Mapbox token added)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Still Failing?

**Check the error message:**
- If still "integrity" errors → Delete `package-lock.json` again
- If "ESLint" errors → Check `package.json` has `"eslint": "^8.57.0"`
- If other errors → Share the error message

**Clear cache and retry:**
- GitHub Settings → Actions → Clear cache
- Re-run workflow

### Vercel Build Failing?

**Check build logs for:**
- Missing environment variables
- TypeScript errors
- Import errors

**Common fixes:**
- Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Check all imports are correct
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`

### App Deployed but Not Working?

**Check runtime logs:**
- Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → [Latest] → Runtime Logs

**Common issues:**
- Missing `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Wrong `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- OAuth not configured
