==============================================
FORCE VERCEL TO USE LATEST CODE
==============================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Vercel keeps deploying commit b2ce3b7 (the old broken one)
But GitHub has commit 90e2457 (with all the fixes)

Vercel's webhook or cache is stuck on old commit.


SOLUTION - Option 1 (Via Vercel Website):
==========================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app

2. Click "Settings" tab (left sidebar)

3. Go to: Git → Disconnect

4. Confirm disconnect

5. Click "Connect Git Repository"

6. Select: jordangilliam/WLA_App

7. Click "Import"

8. It will ask about framework - select Next.js

9. DON'T add environment variables (already done)

10. Click "Deploy"

This will create a fresh connection and deploy latest code.


SOLUTION - Option 2 (Manual Git Override):
===========================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app

2. Click "Deployments" tab

3. Click "Create Deployment" button

4. Under "Git Branch or Commit SHA", enter:
   90e2457

5. Click "Deploy"


SOLUTION - Option 3 (Redeploy via Website):
============================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jordan-gilliams-projects/wla-app/deployments

2. Look for a deployment that says "Ready" or "Error"

3. Click the "..." menu → "Redeploy"

4. UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"

5. Make sure it shows: "Branch: main"

6. Click "Redeploy"

7. Watch the logs - it MUST show commit 90e2457!


WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:
======================
- GitHub webhook to Vercel might be broken
- Vercel cache is stuck on old commit
- Need to force refresh the connection


WHAT THE LOGS SHOULD SAY:
==========================
✓ Cloning... Commit: 90e2457
NOT: Commit: b2ce3b7

==============================================
