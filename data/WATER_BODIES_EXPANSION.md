## Integration Guide

### Option 1: Replace Existing Array
```typescript
import { PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED } from '@/data/pa-water-bodies-expanded';

// In app/fishing/page.tsx
const PA_WATER_BODIES: WaterBody[] = PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED;
```

### Option 2: Merge with Existing
```typescript
import { PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED } from '@/data/pa-water-bodies-expanded';

const PA_WATER_BODIES: WaterBody[] = [
  ...PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED,
  // ... your custom additions
];
```

### Option 3: Filter by Region
```typescript
import { PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED } from '@/data/pa-water-bodies-expanded';

// Only show Philadelphia region
const localWaterBodies = PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED.filter(
  w => w.region === 'Philadelphia'
);
```
