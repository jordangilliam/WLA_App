## Integration Guide

### Option 1: Replace Existing Array
```typescript
import { PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED } from '@/data/pa-water-bodies-expanded';

// In app/fishing/page.tsx
const PA_WATER_BODIES: WaterBody[] = PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED;
```

### Option 2: Merge with Existing
```typescript
import { PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED } from '@/data/pa-water-bodies-expanded';

const PA_WATER_BODIES: WaterBody[] = [
  ...PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED,
  // ... your custom additions
];
```

### Option 3: Filter by Region
```typescript
import { PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED } from '@/data/pa-water-bodies-expanded';

// Only show Philadelphia region
const localWaterBodies = PA_WATER_BODIES_EXPANDED.filter(
  w => w.region === 'Philadelphia'
);
```

## Data Sources

All data compiled from:
- PA Fish & Boat Commission (PFBC)
- PA Department of Conservation & Natural Resources (DCNR)
- County park systems
- Local fishing reports

- Study habitat differences
- Track seasonal patterns

### 4. **Accessibility**
Focus on locations that students can actually reach:

GET /api/fishing/stocking?date=2024-04-01

// Get high-maintenance locations only
GET /api/fishing/locations?maintenance=High

// Get urban-accessible locations
GET /api/fishing/locations?urbanProximity=Urban,Suburban
```
